 Top 20 JavaScript Questions & Answers
What is JavaScript, and why is it used?
JavaScript is a programming language for adding interactivity, dynamic content, and logic to web pages.

Difference between var, let, and const.

var: function-scoped, hoisted, can be redeclared

let: block-scoped, no redeclaration

const: block-scoped, must be initialized, no reassignment.

What is hoisting in JavaScript?
JS moves variable and function declarations to the top before execution.

Difference between == and ===.
== compares values (performs type conversion), === compares values and types (strict).

What is a closure?
A closure is when a function remembers variables from its outer scope even after that scope has closed.

Difference between function declaration and function expression.

Declaration: hoisted (function test(){})

Expression: not hoisted (const test = function(){}).

What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?
Synchronous runs line-by-line, asynchronous allows other tasks to run while waiting (e.g., setTimeout, fetch).

What is the Event Loop in JavaScript?
Mechanism that handles async callbacks by moving them from the task queue to the call stack when free.

Difference between null and undefined.

null: intentional empty value

undefined: variable declared but not assigned.

What are template literals in JavaScript?
Strings using backticks (`\``) with embedded expressions ${value}`.

Difference between map(), forEach(), and filter().

map: returns a new array with transformed values

forEach: loops but returns undefined

filter: returns a new array with matching values.

What is this in JavaScript?
Refers to the object that owns the current execution context (depends on how the function is called).

What are arrow functions, and how are they different from normal functions?
Arrow functions are shorter, donâ€™t have their own this, arguments, or prototype.

What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in JS?

Shallow: copies references (nested objects still linked)

Deep: completely independent copy.

What is async/await in JavaScript?
Syntax for writing asynchronous code that looks synchronous, built on top of Promises.

Difference between localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies.

localStorage: no expiry

sessionStorage: clears on tab close

cookies: small data sent with every request.

What is event delegation in JavaScript?
Attaching one event listener to a parent to handle events for its children via bubbling.

Difference between call(), apply(), and bind().

call: calls with given this & args (comma-separated)

apply: calls with given this & args (array)

bind: returns a new function with given this.

What is the difference between == and Object.is()?
Object.is() is like === but handles NaN and -0 correctly.

What is debouncing and throttling in JavaScript?

Debounce: delay execution until after no calls for a set time

Throttle: limit execution to once per set time interval.

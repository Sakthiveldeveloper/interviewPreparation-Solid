Top 20 React Questions & Answers
What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces using reusable components.

What are components in React?
Components are independent, reusable pieces of UI, either functional or class-based.

What is JSX?
JSX is a syntax extension that looks like HTML but allows writing React elements in JavaScript.

What is the virtual DOM?
A lightweight copy of the real DOM that React uses to efficiently update the UI.

What are props in React?
Props are read-only inputs passed from parent to child components.

What is state in React?
State is an object that holds data that can change over time within a component.

What is the difference between state and props?
Props are passed from parent, immutable inside child; state is managed within the component and can change.

What are lifecycle methods?
Methods in class components that run at different stages: mounting, updating, unmounting (e.g., componentDidMount).

What are React hooks?
Functions like useState, useEffect that let you use state and other React features in functional components.

What does useState do?
Declares state variables in functional components.

What is useEffect used for?
Runs side effects like data fetching or subscriptions after render.

How do you pass data between components?
Using props for parent-to-child; use context or state management libraries for complex cases.

What is lifting state up?
Moving state to a common ancestor to share data between sibling components.

What is a controlled component?
Form elements where React state controls the input value.

What is a key in React lists, and why is it important?
A unique identifier for list items to help React efficiently update the DOM.

What is reconciliation in React?
React’s process of comparing virtual DOM trees to update the real DOM efficiently.

What are higher-order components (HOCs)?
Functions that take a component and return a new enhanced component.

What is React Context?
A way to share data globally without passing props manually at every level.

What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?
React is the core library; ReactDOM handles rendering React components to the DOM.

How do you optimize performance in React?
Using React.memo, lazy loading, code splitting, avoiding unnecessary re-renders.

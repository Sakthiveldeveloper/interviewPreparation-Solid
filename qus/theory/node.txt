Top 20 Node.js Questions & Answers
What is Node.js?
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine to run JS on the server-side.

What is the event-driven architecture in Node.js?
Node.js uses events and callbacks to handle asynchronous operations efficiently.

What is the difference between blocking and non-blocking code?
Blocking code waits for tasks to finish before continuing; non-blocking allows other tasks to run while waiting.

What is the role of the event loop in Node.js?
It manages the execution of asynchronous callbacks and tasks.

What are callbacks in Node.js?
Functions passed as arguments to be executed after an async operation completes.

What are Promises and how are they different from callbacks?
Promises provide a cleaner way to handle async operations and avoid callback hell.

What is process.nextTick() in Node.js?
Schedules a callback to run immediately after the current operation completes, before the event loop continues.

What is the difference between require and import?
require is CommonJS syntax; import is ES6 module syntax.

What is middleware in Node.js?
Functions that execute during request-response cycle in frameworks like Express.js.

What is the purpose of package.json?
It manages project metadata, dependencies, scripts, and configurations.

What is the difference between readFile and readFileSync?
readFile is async (non-blocking), readFileSync is blocking.

What is a stream in Node.js?
Streams are data flows that allow reading/writing data piece-by-piece instead of all at once.

What is the difference between process.env and configuration files?
process.env stores environment variables accessible during runtime.

How does Node.js handle child processes?
Via the child_process module to spawn and communicate with subprocesses.

What is clustering in Node.js?
Running multiple Node.js processes to utilize multi-core CPU for better performance.

How does Node.js handle concurrency?
Uses a single-threaded event loop with async callbacks, not multi-threading.

What is the difference between res.send() and res.json() in Express?
res.send() sends various types, res.json() sends JSON with proper headers.

What is CORS and how do you enable it in Node.js?
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing — allow/disallow requests from other origins, enabled via middleware.

What is the difference between __dirname and process.cwd()?
__dirname is the directory of the current module; process.cwd() is the current working directory.

How do you handle errors in Node.js?
Using callbacks with error-first pattern, try-catch for sync code, and Promise .catch() or async/await error handling.

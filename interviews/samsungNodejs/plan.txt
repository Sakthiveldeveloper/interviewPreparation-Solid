--------------------------------------------
1. Node.js Concepts
Event Loop & Async: Understand how Node.js handles async operations with event loop.
Callbacks, Promises, async/await: Know how to write async code cleanly.
Modules: CommonJS vs ES Modules, how to import/export.
Express.js basics: Routing, middleware, request & response objects.
Error handling: Try/catch, error-first callbacks.
Basic knowledge: process, buffer, streams (optional but helpful).
REST API basics: Creating endpoints, handling GET/POST requests.
2.Database Knowledge (MongoDB)
Basics: What is MongoDB, document-oriented DB, collections vs tables.
CRUD operations: Insert, Find, Update, Delete commands.
Mongoose (if applicable): Schemas, models, validation.
Aggregation basics: Simple pipeline concepts.
Indexing: Why indexes matter (basic idea).
3. System Design (Basics)
You wonâ€™t be expected to do a full design but:
Know the difference between monolithic and microservices.
Understand scalability (horizontal vs vertical scaling).
Basics of caching.
4. Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
Why: They will test your problem-solving and coding skills.
Focus on:
Arrays, Strings basics
Linked Lists
Stacks and Queues
Hash Maps / Hash Sets
Basic sorting and searching
Simple recursion
How Node.js apps scale (clustering, load balancers).
Simple API design principles.
